## ✨ How It Works  
1. **Detects Urdu & Hindi Captions** – When you generate captions in Submagic, the extension finds them automatically.  
2. **Uses AI to Convert Them** – It sends the captions to **Gemini AI**, which transliterates them into **Hinglish**.  
3. **Updates Instantly** – Once the new Hinglish text is ready, the extension **replaces the old captions in real time**.
